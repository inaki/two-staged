# Two.js Playground
Two.js is a nice library that let you code 2 dimensional shapes and animate them. You can do a lot of fun stuff with this library.


This is a single page app that is using socketstream for real-time, and have Two.js and jQuery already
integrated. I styled a stage for playing with the two.js library. The idea
is that you just clone this repo, start the server to take advantage of the real-time feature, and
start playing with [Two.Js](http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/).

## Technology used:
- socketstream framework
- jade
- stylus
- node.js


## Instructions

1. First of all you have to install node.js if not yet installed. For those who need to install node just go [here](http://nodejs.org/).

2. Now you have to clone this repo using git, just copy and paste this in your terminal:

  `git clone https://github.com/inaki/two-staged`

3. Perfect, now you cd to the dir you just cloned:

  `cd /path/to/two-staged`

4. Almost there, just do:

  `npm install`

5. And run the app:

  `npm start`

6. The path for the view you have to edit to play with two.js is:

  `/client/views/app.jade`



### Happy coding!
